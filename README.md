MODELLING DEMENTIA PROGRESSION USING GAUSSIAN HMM &amp; MACHINE LEARNING 

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the project is to track and understand the progress of dementia for earlier diagnosis and better treatment. Dementia is a neurodegenerative condition that refers to the loss or impairment of the daily functions of the human body like thinking, reasoning, remembering and behavior. Several diseases can be the cause of dementia. Dementia is usually associated with old age. The most common underlying cause for dementia is Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
Since dementia is a progressive disease, that is, the symptoms are relatively mild at first and develop gradually over time, dementia is usually diagnosed at a later stage. Studying the disease can help in earlier diagnosis of the disease and developing better treatment methods. 
Modelling and understanding the trajectory of dementia can help us diagnose and gain insights into the disease process at an earlier stage. So, we have developed a model to track the trajectory of the disease using a 2-state Gaussian Hidden Markov Model and Machine Learning. 
To study the changes and transitions during dementia, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are taken into consideration. Mild Cognitive Impairment is an early stage of memory loss or declining mental abilities like thinking and performing complex tasks. 
Based on this data, a 2 state Gaussian Hidden Markov model is implemented. Since Hidden Markov model works on sequential data, it is suitable for tracking the progression and changes in a dementia patient. 
But the HMM itself does not give desirable output as it cannot detect some of the patterns in the data as well as Machine Learning models do. Therefore, we have combined the HMM model with Machine Learning models to improve the accuracy of dementia prediction.
GUI and a Speech Recognition Tool have also been implemented to make it easier to use the model for dementia prediction by users. The GUI tells the user if he/she has dementia or not based on the data they enter into the GUI window. The Speech Recognition Tool further assists by advising the user on what is to be done if they are diagnosed with dementia.
